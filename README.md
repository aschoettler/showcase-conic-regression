# Conic Regression Project
Finding the best-fitting conic section to a given set of points


This is one of many projects I have made exploring nonlinear regression and data modeling.
I have always had an interest in conic sections and in this demo I take a noisy data set
and analytically find the best fitting conic section for the points after defining a model and
loss functions. This technique can be easily generalized to higher dimensions (n > 2).
